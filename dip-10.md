## Simple Summary
Proposal to automate rebases and to fund past code deployments. Rebasing is an important part of Debase stabilization. As gas fees climb, it's important that incentives remain for rebase to called. 
Likewise contract deployments costs need to be covered for deployment of new contracts, will be covered by builder's fees, but part of this allocation should be set aside for 
covering past contract deployments.
Set aside 0.5 pct of the Total supply for covering the cost of calling rebases and funding past deployment of contracts.
These Debases would be spent only during expasions to minimize price impact. 

## Motivation
To incentive rebase calling through automation, and to fund past contract deployments.

## Technical specification
All transactions will be moderated by VidarTheAuditor.
