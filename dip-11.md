## Simple Summary
Increase minimum cap of SP2 rewards pot, as other parameters are fine-tuned to be set to 1.2x the amount of circulating supply of DEBASE burnt at end of contraction cycle. 
This will allow time to find the ideal parameters for SP2.

## Technical specification
The increase will be mediated by VidarTheAuditor through the DEBASE multi-sig.
