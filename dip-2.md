## Simple Summary
Update SP1 parameters to relax LP limits and increase rewards to incentivize DEBASE/DAI LPs to grow the DEBASE economy.

## Abstract
Since SP1 has been launched and the LP limit was hit much faster than expected, this proposal calls to relax LP limits (both pool and wallet limits) and increase rewards to incentivize LPs during positive rebase cycles. While high inflation can cause downward price pressure, low inflation can lead to the same outcome since there is not enough incentive for LPs to take the Impermenant Loss and provide liquidity, which is very important for the protocol during positive rebase cycles. Inflation of some ideal range will grow the economy. This is a best guess at a value within the range.

## Motivation
LPs are an important part of the Debaseonomics protocol and incentivizing them is criticial for the growth of the DEBASE economy.
This proposal aims to incentivize LPs to provide liquidity during the positive rebase cycles using SP1.

## Technical specification

### Parameters to update
* rewardPercentage (Percentage of stabilizer pool rewards requested per reward duration) : Increase from 0.0055 to 0.033 percent
* userLpLimit (LP limit per wallet): Increase from 1K to 3K
* poolLpLimit (Total LP limit per pool): Increase from 30k to 53k
