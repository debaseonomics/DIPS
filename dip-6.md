## Simple summary
Request for grant of 34k USD over the course of the coming year, for Economics Design to do original research in stabilzation mechanisms of the synthetic asset DEBASE, in conjuction with academia, and help build, fine tune a stabilizer pool based on this research that will generate a reserve for DEBASE.

## Abstract
As stabilization mechanisms of algo-stables becomes a important research topic in the field, 
it's important the DEBASE protocol funds research of this nature to be able to stay at the cutting edge. 
To this end, this proposal is a request of 34k USD to be paid out in DEBASE over the next few months to Economics Design, run by Lisa Tan. Lisa and team will design a reserve generating stabilizer pool, help build it. 
She and her team will be further retained over the course of a year, 
fine tune parameters once it goes live according to market reaction and other up-keeping activities. 
To this end, Economics design will work with new developers and academia (specicially monetary theroists), both welcome additions to the world of Debaseonomics.

## Motivation
DEBASE is meant to stabilize towards the target range fixed by governance. 
In line with the vision of Debaseonomics to use stabilizer-pools to stabilize DEBASE price, reaserch on stabilization is a core part of the DEBASE vision.

## Technical specification
The grant will be paid out over the following milestones over the following months (3 Months minimum):
1) Onboarding: 7,640 USDC + 10.2k Debase (Already paid out by private investor when Debase was at 1 Dai; they will be reimbursed)
2) High level 2 pager initial model upon brainstorming: 4760 USDC
3) Low level details and building out pool with developers: 7140 USDC
4) Final report: 4760 USDC
