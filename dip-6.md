## Simple summary
Request for grant of 34k USD over the coming year, to be paid to Economics Design ((https://www.economicsdesign.com) to do original research in stabilization mechanisms of the synthetic asset DEBASE, in conjunction with academia, and help build, fine-tune a stabilizer pool based on this research that will generate a reserve for DEBASE.

## Abstract
As stabilization mechanisms of algo-stables become an important research topic in the field, it's important the DEBASE protocol funds research of this nature be able to stay at the cutting edge. To this end, this proposal is a request of 34k USD to be paid out in DEBASE over the next few months to Economics Design, run by Lisa Tan. Lisa and the team will design a reserve generating stabilizer pool, help build it. She and her team will be further retained over the course of a year, fine-tune parameters once it goes live according to market reaction and other up-keeping activities. To this end, Economics design will work with new developers and academia (specifically, monetary theorists), both welcome additions to the world of Debaseonomics.

## Motivation
DEBASE is meant to stabilize towards the target range fixed by governance. Reserves in other assets will be an important aspect of stabilization as it will strengthen belief in the asset holding it's peg. Therefore the research and subsquent design will focus on build reserves to stabilize Debase. 

## Technical specification
The grant will be paid out over the following milestones over the following months (3 Months minimum):
1) Onboarding: 7,640 USDC + 10.2k Debase (Already paid out by private investor when Debase was at 1 Dai; they will be reimbursed)
2) High level 2 pager initial model upon brainstorming: 4760 USDC
3) Low level details and building out pool with developers: 7140 USDC
4) Final report: 4760 USDC
(USDC amounts will be converted to DEBASE on day grants are paid out)

### Notes
The grant process will be mediated by VidarTheAuditor to ensure integrity; he will audit the smartcontract written to request the grant. All assets will be first transfered from the rewards contract to the multi-sig where he is signatory.
